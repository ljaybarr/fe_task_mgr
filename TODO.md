# To Do List

1. Create the error.html template, which should show the user the resulting HTTP status code and a generic error message.
2. Create the success.html template, which should show the user a generic success message and render the data from 'msg'.
3. Add links for viewing the list of tasks as well as creating new tasks to your navbar.
4. Create the new task form (and resulting flow) as well as all the routes, templates and functions this will entail.
5. Edit your table so the edit link takes you to the edit form.
6. Test!
